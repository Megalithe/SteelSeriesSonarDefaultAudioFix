#The clunky solution for me was a powershell script.
#First open a text editor such as Notepad and paste in the text from the .ps1 script in this repository.
#Save the file as a .ps1 file.  I called mine SetDefaultAudio.ps1

##Create a Task to Run the Fix.
#Open Task Scheduler. 
#Windows Key + Press Enter, the Run Box displays. Type: taskschd. msc and press enter
